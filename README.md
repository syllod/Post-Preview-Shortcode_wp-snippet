# Post Preview Shortcode

This is a WordPress snippet that creates a shortcode to display a preview of a post based on the provided post ID.

## Usage

1. Copy the code from the `post-preview-shortcode-snippet.php` file.

2. In your WordPress theme's `functions.php` file or in a custom plugin, paste the code.

3. Use the following shortcode in any WordPress post or page to display a post preview: [post_preview id="123"]
Replace "123" with the actual ID of the post you want to preview.

## Customization

You can customize the output of the post preview by modifying the `post_preview_shortcode` function in the code. Adjust the HTML structure and styling to match your requirements. You can also add or remove elements as needed.
